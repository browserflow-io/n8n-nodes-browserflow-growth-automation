# Customer documentation — 1.1.5

The README now introduces research, enrichment, monitoring, sales, finance and
operations use cases, followed by setup, input mapping and result reuse.
The package description and repository About text use the same customer-facing
summary. Node behavior, credentials and workflow identifiers are unchanged.

Reviewed against the official n8n verification, submission and UX guidelines on
4 October 2026. Keep English installation/authentication instructions, an example
workflow, compatibility, practical limits and support links in the public README.
Do not describe this package as verified or available on n8n Cloud before approval.
Raf handles the Creator Portal submission and communications himself.

## Development

Use Node.js 24. Run `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, `npm run check`, and `npm run dev`.
The checks cover behavior, strict n8n lint and the publication boundary. Release
only this standalone package through **Publish Browserflow plugin**, with the exact
unused version from package.json. Run its CI first; publish with provenance and
verify the actual registry archive using the official n8n scanner afterwards.

Current package: `@browserflow/n8n-nodes-browserflow-growth-automation`.
Current repository: `browserflow-io/n8n-nodes-browserflow-growth-automation`.
The older notes below are historical evidence, not current publication instructions.
The website preview gate has since been removed; account/subscription requirements
still apply. Review access is arranged privately, never in the public README.

## Earlier releases

# Package rename — 1.1.4

The active package is `@browserflow/n8n-nodes-browserflow-growth-automation`.
The repository is `browserflow-io/n8n-nodes-browserflow-growth-automation`.
The node displays **Browserflow for Growth Automation**. It retains version 1/1.1
parameters, the existing OAuth credential type, batching and the input refresh fix.
The former scoped package remains available for existing workflows. To migrate,
replace its node with the new package and reuse the existing credential and inputs;
saved node type identifiers contain the package name and are not renamed automatically.
Use the new package and repository for Creator Portal submission.

The notes below describe earlier releases under the former name.

## On-demand flow picker — 1.1.2

New node version 1.1 uses n8n's searchable resource locator instead of eager
options loading, which can race automatic credential selection on a new node.
Existing version-1 nodes keep their saved parameters. Both string IDs and new
locator values are supported for input schemas and execution. OAuth behavior,
run admission, Limit/Offset validation and the 100-item cap are unchanged.

# Release preparation

Prepared on 30 September 2026. Package: **@browserflow/n8n-nodes-browser-flow@1.0.0**.
Repository: **browserflow-io/n8n-nodes-browser-flow**. Display name: **Browserflow**.

## Smaller batches — 1.1.1

Version 1.1.1 lowers the maximum Limit to 100 items per list per execution.
Offset remains a skip index up to 250000 so subsequent batches can use 100, 200,
etc. Values above 100 are rejected before starting a run. The matching backend
release also caps recorded defaults at 100 when Limit is omitted.

## List batching — 1.1.0

Version 1.1.0 adds optional **Limit** and **Offset** controls under Options.
They are forwarded separately from dynamic flow inputs, with integer validation
(Limit 1–5000, Offset 0–250000). Omitting both preserves existing behavior.
Each batch repeats the recorded flow; recorded pagination and page limits apply.
Requires the Browserflow backend release with run batching support. Existing node
and credential identifiers are unchanged. Publish only the scoped package using
the guarded workflow; the legacy package remains untouched.

## Copy update — 1.0.1

Version 1.0.1 changes the node description to “Scrape leads, collect market data,
and automate sales tasks”, with matching npm metadata and README introduction.
Node behavior, credentials and saved workflow identifiers are unchanged.
Publish this version with the existing guarded workflow after package checks.

Version 1.0.0 was published from `38f480c` with GitHub Actions provenance on
1 October 2026 (run `36861580497`). The official n8n registry scanner 0.38.0 and
a disposable n8n 2.39.8 test of the downloaded registry archive passed, including
PKCE, fixture browser output, refresh and revocation. These results supersede
the earlier prepublication status below. Hosted registry-version testing,
toolchain advisory review and Creator Portal submission remain separate gates.

## Evidence and remaining gates

- Local package build and nine behavioral tests pass; strict n8n lint and package
  boundary checks are part of `npm run check`.
- The actual tarball passed an independent disposable n8n 2.39.8 acceptance test:
  package/credential discovery, PKCE without managed instance overrides or client
  secret, dynamic schemas, real fixture browser output `{ "answer": 42 }`, token
  refresh and revoked-access rejection. The acceptance harness lives in the
  owning Browserflow app (`test/n8n-package.test.mjs`) because it runs the backend
  and its dedicated PostgreSQL test database as well.
- Raf reported a successful hosted workflow with the earlier local adapter. This
  is not a claim that this new package was installed from the npm registry.
- npm publication, registry provenance verification, the published-package n8n
  scanner and Creator Portal review have not yet completed.
- Arrange private-preview access and a review account with a harmless published
  flow. Do not publish preview passwords or account tokens in this repository.
- Coordinate with n8n about the existing LinkedIn listing and the new platform
  listing. Their rules reject duplicate nodes; a separate repository does not
  itself guarantee acceptance. Explain the different API/platform and ownership.

## Readiness check — 1 October 2026

Only `@browserflow/n8n-nodes-browser-flow` may be published. The workflow explicitly
checks both this package name and its standalone repository; the existing
`n8n-nodes-browserflow` package must not be updated or replaced.

Raf requested preparation only for human communications: do not contact n8n or
submit the Creator Portal form on his behalf.

- Rebuilt commit `ba7dc2f` locally: nine tests, strict lint and the 13-file package
  boundary check passed. The boundary check used a temporary npm cache after the
  default cache was blocked by local filesystem permissions.
- Re-ran the packed-node acceptance test in disposable n8n 2.39.8 and the separate
  test database: PKCE, typed browser output `answer: 42`, refresh and revocation
  all passed. The persistent n8n workspace and running app were not restarted.
- The signed-in npm account is `browserflow`. Its package list contains only
  `n8n-nodes-browserflow`; there are no staged releases. The account reports that
  2FA was initially disabled; the owner subsequently enabled it, verified below.
  No token was generated by the agent.
- GitHub still shows successful CI and CodeQL for `ba7dc2f`, with no publication
  runs. No repository/environment/organization Actions secrets are available.
  Publication credentials therefore remain an owner setup step.
- GitHub reports five development dependency advisories (lodash, form-data,
  uuid and stream-json). The fresh npm audit reports 17 affected dependency
  entries including inherited findings (10 high, 7 moderate), also involving
  axios and qs. These are the development/tooling graph; the verified tarball
  bundles no dependencies. Do not call the audit clean. Upstream exact pins and
  major-only fixes (including stream-json 1.x) need review before changing the
  toolchain; do not apply `npm audit fix --force`, which proposes an old CLI
  incompatible with the n8n provenance requirements. The registry scanner and
  hosted registry-package test remain outstanding.
- The package was renamed on 1 October to `@browserflow/n8n-nodes-browser-flow`
  with Raf's approval after npm rejected the unscoped name as too similar
  to the legacy package. The GitHub repository was renamed to
  `browserflow-io/n8n-nodes-browser-flow`, with package links and the release
  identity guard updated together. Earlier CI and archive evidence
  describes the pre-rename candidate; use the rebuilt candidate and rerun CI
  before publication. The old archive digest is superseded.
- The renamed candidate passed all nine tests, strict lint, the package boundary
  check and a fresh installed-package acceptance test (PKCE, typed browser output,
  refresh, revocation). npm returned 404 for the new package name on 1 October;
  recheck availability at publication time.
- The prior inspection archive is superseded by the repository URL changes.
  Inspect the final CI-built registry archive after publication.
- The npm account now confirms 2FA enabled for authorization and publishing.
  The owner configured `NPM_TOKEN` in GitHub Actions; its presence was verified
  without reading the value. The publication workflow must verify that it works.

The owner should arrange a short-lived bootstrap publication
credential directly in GitHub Actions as `NPM_TOKEN`, never in chat. The current
workflow uses `npm publish`; a stage-only token will not work with it. If choosing
npm staged publishing instead, first change the workflow to `npm stage publish`
with npm CLI >=11.15.0, retain provenance, and have the owner approve the staged
version with 2FA. Do not broaden token scope or bypass 2FA without owner approval.

## First npm release

1. Confirm that the npm maintainer represents Browserflow and matches repository
   ownership. Confirm the package name is still available.
2. Run `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and `npm run check`. Push the reviewed commit to
   `main`, and require its **Check Browserflow plugin** workflow to pass.
3. Authorize GitHub Actions to publish. Prefer npm Trusted Publishing. For a new
   package that cannot yet configure a publisher, use an appropriately scoped,
   short-lived npm granular publication token as the `NPM_TOKEN` Actions secret
   (environment `npm` or repository). The account owner creates and enters this
   credential privately; never paste it in chat or commit it.
4. Manually run **Publish Browserflow plugin** from `main`, entering **1.0.0**.
   This checks that the version is unused and publishes with `--provenance`.
   A source push alone does not publish anything. Never publish the first
   verified-node release directly from a local computer.
5. Check the public npm version, repository link, maintainer and provenance
   against the exact GitHub workflow/commit. Then run:

   ```sh
   npm exec --ignore-scripts --yes --package=@n8n/scan-community-package@0.38.0 -- scan-community-package @browserflow/n8n-nodes-browser-flow@1.0.0
   ```

   The scanner requires a published npm package. Read the actual result; its
   displayed security-check failure must block submission even if the process
   exits successfully.

6. Install that registry version in a disposable self-hosted n8n and verify a
   hosted test account connection/run. Add npm Trusted Publishing with owner
   `browserflow-io`, repository `n8n-nodes-browser-flow`, workflow
   `publish.yml`, environment `npm`. Revoke the bootstrap token after setup.
7. Submit through the Creator Portal only after Raf finishes coordination and
   authorizes submission. Use the prepared text below and current evidence.

For later releases, update the version and lockfile together, run the checks,
push, and manually publish the exact version. npm versions cannot be overwritten.
The app and legacy LinkedIn node have independent release histories.

## Creator Portal handoff text

Use after npm publication and the remaining checks above. Do not claim n8n has
already approved the split or that private-preview access is public.
